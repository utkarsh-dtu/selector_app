onChange(undefined)

e.stopPropagation() -> it will stop the click event from going to the the parent div
for example, in our project, the container div (which had an onClick, setting the drop down to open) contained the button (and button contained an onClick which would clear the contents) so if i click on the button, the onClick of that button will be triggered, and this event will pass on to the parent as well. so to stop this propagation we use the e.stopPropagation() method

why moving .options.selected before .options.highlighted overrides it?
